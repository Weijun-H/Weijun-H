I'm interested in system programming, database management system, and distributed system. I'm currently contributing to [arrow-datafusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion) and [arrow-rs](https://github.com/apache/arrow-rs). When not working on technical projects, I enjoy rock climbing 🧗🏻‍♀️. Looking for PhD opportunity in data management.

## Previous open source contributions:
- Google Summer of Code **Mentor** at [MariaDB](https://github.com/MariaDB/server)
- LFX Mentorship at [Vitess](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess), which is a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL.
- Alibaba Summer of Code at [PolarDB](https://github.com/alibaba/polardb), which is a distributed database system.
- Google Summer of Code at [MariaDB](https://github.com/MariaDB/server), which is commercially supported fork of the MySQL relational database management system.

If you have any questions or if there's anything I can help with, feel free to reach out to me by [email](mailto:huangweijun1001@gmail.com). I'm always happy to connect and collaborate with others.
