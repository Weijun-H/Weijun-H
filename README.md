I'm an Msc student at [DTU](https://www.dtu.dk/english), Denmark. I'm interested in system programming, database management system, and distributed system. I'm currently contributing to [MariaDB](https://github.com/MariaDB/server). And I spend an amount of time climbing rocks🧗🏻‍♀️.
## Previous open source contributions:
- LFX Mentorship at [Vitess](https://github.com/vitessio/vitess), which is a database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL.
- Alibaba Summer of Code at [PolarDB](https://github.com/alibaba/polardb), which is a distributed database system.
- Google Summer of Code at [MariaDB](https://github.com/MariaDB/server), which is commercially supported fork of the MySQL relational database management system.

If you have any questions or if there's anything I can help with, feel free to reach out to me by [email](mailto:huangweijun1001@gmail.com). I'm always happy to connect and collaborate with others.
